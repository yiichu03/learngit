# Final Project

Topic:

- Based on the class material
- Focus on learning but not feature extraction
- Can be related to your research, but it has to be extended

What to submit:

- A report
  - FontSize 12, single column, 2-3 pages.
- The Code
  - Explicitly label, which part of the code is implemented yourself, by labeling
    - START: OWNCODE, right before your own implemented code
    - END: OWNCODE, right after your own implemented code
- Your file should be named: EEC4300_YourName.zip

## Report

- In the report, you should:
  - Define the problem
    - What is the problem you are trying to solve?
  - Show connection to class material
    - What is being classified, what are the classes, etc.
  - Describe data
    - Train/test splits, etc.
  - Show results of at least two learning models
    - Why do you see such results?
    - What results will you get if you tune the parameters?
    - What insights can you obtain?

## project

- ==Object/person recognition==
  - PCA: Eigenfaces, eigendogs, etc.
  - HOG vs. SIFT
  - Data: Caltech 101/256, PASCAL, MIT Labelme, Yale face database, â€¦

## Project Will be Evaluated on

- Novelty of Application
- Models Chosen
- Experimental Results and Analysis
- Report Quality
